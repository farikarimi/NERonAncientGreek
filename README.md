This paper presents the results in the adaptation of a new workflow of Named Entity Recognition
and classification applied to Ancient Greek. We used a model of data extraction and pattern
discovery based on machine learning algorithms which is easily customizable for different
languages. This allowed the creation of a dataset of automatically classified toponyms and
ethnonyms starting from a small manually annotated list.
