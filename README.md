# NERonAncientGreek
This repository contains the code for the adaptation of a new workflow of Named Entity Recognition and classification applied to primary sources in Ancient Greek. We used a model of language-independent data extraction and pattern discovery based on machine learning algorithms, which allowed the extraction of a dataset of automatically classified place-names and ethnonyms starting from a small manually annotated dataset.
